# Arduino UNO Projects

This repository contains several Arduino UNO projects that I have undertaken, inlcuding:
- BitsToBarLeds: Writing binary bits to a bar LED
- SevenSegment: Randomly picking a HEX number from the HEX table and displaying it to the seven segment display
- ClickArryas: Starting off with a set number of arrays and allow the user to change the arrays, through the length/amount of time the switch has been clicked
- LIFO: Add or remove to LIFO buffer, depending on wether SW1 or SW2 is clicked and then print the arrays with the amount of used slots
- AverageDirection: Take an input of letters and non-alphabetic entities and put only the directional letters from the input into a buffer with a max length of 10. The                      resultant hould then be calculated and printed, along with the hand-side it is pointing, the slope and compass direction
- BitsToBinary: Run a specific sequence of Binary numbers displayed as LEDs on the BAR LED all for specific amounts of time
